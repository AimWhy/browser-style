    <h1>This is HTML and browser.style core: 2kb&hellip;</h1>
    <p>In the beginning, Tim Berners-Lee created <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. He was a British computer scientist working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. In 1989, he proposed a new way to share information over the internet using a system of hypertext documents. These documents would be linked together using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hyperlinks</a>, and they could be displayed in a web browser.</p>
    <p>Berners-Lee called his system the World Wide Web, and he wrote the first version of HTML to create web pages. HTML is a markup language, which means that it uses tags to describe the structure and content of a web page. The tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they tell the web browser how to display the text, images, and other elements of the page.</p>

      <figcaption><em>You won't find a computer today without at least one browser installed.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The first version of HTML was very simple, but it quickly evolved to support more complex features. In 1993, Berners-Lee released version 1.0 of HTML, which included support for tables, forms, and images. In 1995, version 2.0 of HTML was released, which added support for frames, cascading style sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>HTML has continued to evolve over the years, and the latest version, HTML5, was released in 2014. HTML5 includes support for many new features, such as video, audio, and geolocation. It also makes it easier to create responsive web pages that look good on all devices.</p>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and it is still the most popular markup language in use today. It is used to create web pages for businesses, organizations, and individuals all over the world. HTML is a powerful tool that can be used to create anything from simple static pages to complex interactive applications.</p>

    <h2>Coding HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they tell the web browser how to display the text, images, and other elements of the page.</p>
    <p>For example, the following code will create a simple web page with the text "Hello, world!" in the center of the page:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>

    Note, that tags like <del>&lt;center&gt;</del> and <del>&lt;big&gt;</del> have been replaced with <ins>CSS</ins>.<br>
    It's possible to have <sup>superscript</sup> as well as <sub>subscript</sub>

    <p>
      In a code-editor like <em>VS Code</em>, you can create a new HTML-document using the
      <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
