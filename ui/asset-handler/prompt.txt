In this project, I want to create a web-component for handling assets.

We'll get back to that, because first I need a node express server which can handle file delivery, image resize and file uploads.

I think we need these endpoints:

/asset:id GET Returns a specific asset, with optional dimensions and dpi
/asset:id POST Stores a file in specified folder structure
/asset-list/:id Retrieves files stored in a specific folder, based on the specified folder structure

I don't know about the folder structure.
I have a client which have more than 400.000 products.
Each product can have multiple assets (images, pdfs etc), one asset should be marked as "default"
I know that some operating systems can have issues with storing such a large amount of assests in the same folder

Currently, they have a structure like this - based on the product SKU number, in this example, the full SKU number is "123456":

/assets
  /123_
		/123456/*

Before creating any code, lay out a plan - and let me know, if there are existing, free projects which can do these things.

The web-component should be a file uploader with progressive upload status.
From attributes we should be able to define the file/folder structure as above (if we're going in that direction)

We also need to limit which file-types we can upload, set a max-size in MB, consider security etc.
