	<h1>UI: Components</h1>

	<h2>Text Editor</h2>
	<p>Minimal <strong>Text Editor</strong>, using the <code>&lt;ui-richtext&gt;</code> web component.</p>

	<div class="ui-text-editor"></div>

	<hr>
	<p>Advanced Text-Editor with <code>data-toolbar-items</code> and <code>data-input-types</code>:</p>

		<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.</p>
		<p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
		<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>
		<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>
